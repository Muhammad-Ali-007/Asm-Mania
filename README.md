# Pacman Assembly Game

## Description

This assembly code is an implementation of the classic game Pacman. It's a text-based version of the game where you control Pacman to collect dots while avoiding mines in a maze. The game provides a simple interface and features such as scoring, lives, and a timer.

## Features

- Pacman character controlled using arrow keys (up, down, left, right).
- Collect dots to score points.
- Avoid mines to prevent losing lives.
- Timer counts the time played.
- Restart the game using the 'r' key.
- Quit the game with the 'q' key.
- Level completion and game-over messages.
- Basic UI with borders, score area, lives area, and timer area.

## Usage

1. To assemble and run the game, you need to have a compatible x86 assembly compiler and environment set up, such as DOSBOX.
2. Use your assembly compiler to assemble the code (typically with `.asm` or `.asmx` file extensions). For example, in DOSBOX, you might use the TASM assembler:
3. Link the object file to create an executable:   
4. Run the game:
5. Use the arrow keys to control Pacman, collect dots, and avoid mines.
6. To restart the game, press 'r'.
7. To quit the game, press 'q'.

## Customization

- You can modify the game variables in the `.Data` section to change aspects of the game, such as the number of dots to win and the starting position of Pacman.

- You can also customize the game's visual appearance by adjusting the colors and characters used in the code.
